\section{Projected Gradient Descent with $k$ queries per round}
We now present that main result, a regret bound for generic $k$ randomized query feedback.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:OGD}
	Assume that the functions $\lt$ are strongly convex and $L$-smooth. Assume further that the gradient norms are bounded. Then, the dynamic regret $Regret_T^d$ for the sequence of actions $x_t$ generated by OGD is bounded by
	
	$$Regret_T^d(OGD) \leq G K_1 \sum_{t=2}^T \norm{\xst - x_{t-1}^*} + G K_2$$
	
	where the constants $K_1$ and $K_2$ are explicitly given by
	
	$$K_1 := \frac{\norm{x_1 - x_1^*} - \rho \norm{x_T - x_T^*}}{(1-\rho)}, ~~ K_2 := \frac{1}{1-\rho}.$$
	
	Where $0 \leq \rho := (1-\eta\mu) ^ {1/2} < 0$. Is our linear convergence constant.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:2}
	For any point $x \in \K$,
	
	$$\frac{1}{k} \sumk \lt(y_{t,i}) - \ell_t(x) \leq  \lt(x_t) -  \lt((1-\xi)x) + G\delta + GD\xi.$$
	
\end{lemma}
 
\begin{proof}
	By assumption of Lipschitz continuity,
	
	$$\lt(y_{t,i}) \leq \lt(x_t) + G \delta.$$
	
	We also have that by the Lipschitz property and $\norm{x} \leq D$, for all $x \in \K$,
	$$\lt((1-\xi)x) \leq \lt(x) + GD\xi.$$
	
	Combining the above two inequalities we get
	$$\frac{1}{k} \sumk \lt(y_{t,i}) + \lt((1-\xi)x) \leq +\lt(x_t) + \lt(x) +  G \delta + GD\xi.$$
	
	Rearranging terms gives us the Lemma.
	
	
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem} \label{thm:one}
	Assume that the assumptions hold. Suppose on round $t$ the algorithm plays $k$ random queries $y_{t,1}, ..., y_{t,k}$, constructs a gradient estimator $\tilde{g}_t$ and uses the the algorithmic step $x_{t+1} = \proj[(1-\xi)\K]{(x_t - \eta \tilde{g}_t)}$ with $1/\eta \geq L$, $\delta = \frac{\log(T)}{T}$, and $\xi = \frac{\delta}{r}$. If the gradient estimator satisfies the following conditions for all $t \geq 1$:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\norm{x_t - y_{t,i}} \leq \delta \text{ for } i = 1, ... k$.
		\item $\norm{\tildegt} \leq G_1$ for some constant $G_1$.
		\item $\norm{\E_t \tildegt - \glt(x_t)} \leq c\delta$ for some constant $c$. 
		 
	\end{enumerate}
	Then for any sequence $\{\xst\}_{t=1}^{T} \in \K^T$ we have
	
	$$\E \frac{1}{k} \sumt \sumk \lt(y_{t,i}) - \E \sumt \min_{\xst\in \K}\ell_t(\xst) \leq G_1 K_1 \sum_{t=2}^T \norm{\xst - x_{t-1}^*} + G_1 K_2 + G \log(T)\big(1 + 2c + \frac{D}{r}\big).$$
	
	where the constants $K_1$ and $K_2$ are explicitly given by
	
	$$K_1 := \frac{\norm{x_1 - x_1^*} - \rho \norm{x_T - x_T^*}}{(1-\rho)}, ~~ K_2 := \frac{1}{1-\rho}.$$
	
	Where $0 \leq \rho := (1-\eta\mu) ^ {1/2} < 0$. Is our linear convergence constant.
	

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Start by defining $h_t(x) = \lt(x) + (\tildegt - \glt(x))^\intercal x$. Then $h_t$ has the same convexity properties as $\lt$. Note also that $\nabla h_t(x_t) = \tildegt$. So the algorithm is actually performing gradient descent, as if with full information) on the functions $h_t$ restricted to $(1-\xi) \K$. Using the regret bound from Lemma \ref{lem:OGD} we have that
	$$\E \sumt \frac{1}{k} \sumk \lt(y_{t,i}) - \E \sumt \lt(\xst) \leq G_1 K_1 \sum_{t=2}^T \norm{\xst - x_{t-1}^*} + G_1 K_2 := Regret_{T}^d(OGD).$$
	
	Then taking expectations, 
	
	\begin{align*}
		\E \sumt [\lt(x_t) - \lt(\xst)] &= \E \sumt [h_t(x_t) - h_t(\xst)] + \E \sumt[\lt(x_t) - h_t(x_t) - \lt(\xst) + h_t(\xst)] \\
		&\leq Regret_{T}^d(OGD) + \E \sumt (\E_t \tildegt - \glt(x_t))^\intercal(x_t - \xst)\\
		& \leq Regret_{T}^d(OGD) + 2c\delta DT.
	\end{align*}
	
	Where the first inequality is by the convexity of $\ell_t$ and $h_t$. Now we use Lemma \ref{lem:2} and obtain
	
	$$\E \frac{1}{k} \sumt \sumk \lt(y_{t,i}) - \E \sumt \min_{\xst\in \K}\ell_t(\xst) \leq Regret_{T}^d(OGD) + 2c\delta DT + TG\delta + GDT\xi.$$
	
	To finish the proof, plug in the values for $\delta$ and $\xi$.
	
\end{proof}

As an example, this theorem can be used to show that the following gradient estimator has no-regret.

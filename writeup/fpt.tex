\subsection{Fixed Parameter Tractability}\label{subsec:fpt}

Though \dwin~is \tp-complete, what can be done if we
fix the number of candidates or voters?
Here we mention that \dwin~is fixed parameter tractable
in the number of editing operations, the number of
candidates
and the number of voters \citep{bartholdiVoting}.
First, for a fixed constant $m = \norm{C}$, there is a
FPT algorithm that is exponential in the fixed constant $m$:

\begin{proposition}{\citep{bartholdiVoting}}
    Let $m \in \mathbb{N}^+$.
    There exists a polynomial time algorithm $A_m$ that
    computes all Dodgson scores (and thus all Dodgson Winners)
    in Dodgson elections having at most $m$ candidates.
\end{proposition}

The above result uses integer linear programming while the results
showing fixed parameter tractability in the number of
editing operations utilize dynamic programming.

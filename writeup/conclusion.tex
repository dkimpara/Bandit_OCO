\section{Conclusion}

In the project we have shown that \dwin~ is \tp-complete by using recent
results from \citet{compsat}.
We have also expanded upon the theory of the polynomial hierarchy and the classes
$\Theta_k^P$, which is not commonly known.
Finally, experimental results of a polynomial time heuristic algorithm,
\gwin, were presented.

We mention a few possible extensions.
First, is there a way to use SAT solvers or Integer Linear Programming to
solve \dscore?
This would enable a better algorithm for solving \dwin.
While pursuing a backtracking based modification of \gwin, we ran into the
barrier that one would have to verify that any branch was in fact the minimum
amount of swaps to make a candidate a Condorcet winner.
This would be another avenue to investigate.

\section{Experiments}

In this section we present empirical results based on our
implementation the ~ algorithm from the previous section (see appendix for
the python code).
As proved in the previous section, the algorithm should succeed with high
probability when $n \sim \Omega(m^2)$ so we tested values for $n$ ranging between
$n = m^{1.5}$ to $m^{2.5}$ for each $m$ between 5 and 50.
For $m \in [50,100]$ we ran experiments for $n = m^{2.1}$ to $m^{2.5}$
Note that the experimental values for $m$ were not evenly spaced apart.
Each pair of $n,m$ was run for 100 trials, each trial consisting of generating
an election uniformly at random, picking a random candidate to test, and running ~ on that
instance.
A success was when returned ``definitely'', as in it was self-knowingly correct.

At 100 candidates, the 100 trials took 9 hours, while at 5 candidates, the trials
took about 3 minutes.

    ~algorithm. Each line color corresponds to a particular
    number of candidates. 100 trials were run for each pair of $n,m$.
    Error bars were omitted to not clutter the graph. For reference they
    are at most $ 0.08$.}
